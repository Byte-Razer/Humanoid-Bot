## 🧠 Overview

The **Humanoid Project** is a school-based research and development initiative focused on building an intelligent, interactive humanoid system.  

My story:
Hey this is Mohit here, creator of the GUI of AURA. I was inspired by Jarvis when making the GUI and this gave me the idea of using a pulsing orb.
A task seemingly impossible, but I knew AURA wouldn't be as complete as it is without that pulsing heartbeat. Now I can't imagine AURA without it.
